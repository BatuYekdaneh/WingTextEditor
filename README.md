# WingTextEditor
This project is an experimental project that I learn how to create a programming language and how to use ASP.net as well. All of the information about 'Wing' will be in the website that is starting to be built. Windows only.
This is the non-command editor version of the my other project that is 'WingCommandEditor'.
